"""A Garmin session that treats the shared token store as the source of truth.

The bug this exists to remove: every service in this fleet read the shared
token file once at startup, cached the resulting client for the life of the
process, and never looked at the file again. Because Garmin rotates the refresh
token on every refresh, whichever process refreshed second was holding a token
that had already been replaced — and the resulting 401 arrived typed as a
connection error, so the poisoned client was never dropped. The service then
failed identically on every subsequent call until it was restarted.

``GarminSession`` closes that by never trusting its in-memory copy:

* **Before each use** it re-reads the store. If the blob moved, a peer rotated
  the token, so the cached client is dropped and rebuilt from the current one.
* **After each use** it publishes, so a rotation this process performed is
  immediately visible to peers.
* **On an auth failure** it invalidates, so the next call rebuilds from the
  store rather than reusing a client Garmin has already rejected.

Both steps happen inside ``store.locked()``, so a peer cannot interleave a
refresh between the read and the write.

The library is never given the shared path. Tokens are materialised into a
private scratch directory and *that* is handed to ``Garmin.login()``, so
garminconnect's internal ``_refresh_session()`` dumps rotations somewhere
harmless; this class remains the only writer to the shared store.
